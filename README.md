# Is This Bannable
**CAUTION:** UTILIZE THIS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION. Like all similar programs, there is an inherent risk involved as employing the VALORANT API in this way goes against Riot's Terms of Service. It's worth noting that no suspensions have been reported thus far as a result of using this program. However, given the circumstances, it's advisable to consider using it exclusively on an alternate account if you wish to avoid any potential API misuse-related suspensions, although such a scenario is unlikely.
